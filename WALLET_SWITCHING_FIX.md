# Wallet Switching Fix

## Problem

The WalletDropdown component was experiencing `WalletNotSelectedError` when trying to change wallets. This happened because:

1. The wallet selection and connection weren't properly synchronized
2. When changing wallets, the previous wallet state wasn't properly cleared
3. The timing between disconnect, select, and connect operations was too short

## Solution Applied

### 1. Improved `handleWalletSelect` Function

- Added proper wallet validation before selection
- Added logging for debugging wallet state changes
- Increased timeout for wallet selection to 500ms (from 300ms)
- Added proper disconnect wait time (500ms) when switching wallets
- Added retry logic for `WalletNotSelectedError`
- Added specific handling for `WalletNotReadyError`

### 2. Enhanced Disconnect Logic

- Added `setIsOpen(false)` to close dropdown after disconnect
- Added `select(null)` to properly clear wallet selection after disconnect

### 3. Better Error Handling

- Added specific error type checking
- Added retry mechanism for failed connections
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

## Testing Steps

1. Open the app at http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Select Wallet" and choose a wallet (e.g., Phantom)
3. After connection, click "Change" to open the wallet dropdown
4. Select a different wallet from the dropdown
5. Verify that the wallet switches without errors
6. Test disconnect functionality
7. Test reconnecting after disconnect

## Expected Behavior

- Wallet switching should work smoothly without `WalletNotSelectedError`
- The UI should properly reflect the current wallet state
- Disconnecting should clear the wallet selection completely
- Console should show clear logging of wallet state changes

## Key Changes Made

```typescript
// Better timing and state management
if (connected && wallet?.adapter.name !== walletName) {
  await disconnect();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
}

// Proper wallet selection
select(selectedWallet.adapter.name);

// Longer timeout for connection
setTimeout(async () => {
  await connect();
}, 500);

// Retry logic for failed connections
if (error.name === "WalletNotSelectedError") {
  select(selectedWallet.adapter.name);
  setTimeout(() => connect().catch(console.error), 200);
}
```
