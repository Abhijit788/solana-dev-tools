# Transaction and Compute Unit Tracking Implementation

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. **TypeScript Type Definitions** (`src/types/index.ts`)

- `TransactionDetails`: Complete transaction information including compute units
- `ComputeUnitUsage`: Per-instruction compute unit breakdown
- `WalletTransactionHistory`: Hook state management types
- `SolanaConnectionConfig`: Connection configuration types
- Additional supporting types for comprehensive transaction analysis

### 2. **Solana Client Utility** (`src/lib/solanaClient.ts`)

- Configurable Solana connection to devnet with commitment levels
- Health check functionality
- Network information retrieval
- Cluster connection helpers for different environments
- Default connection instance with optimal settings

### 3. **React Hook** (`src/hooks/useRecentTransactions.ts`)

- Fetches recent transactions for connected wallet (limit 5)
- Parses compute units consumed per instruction
- Aggregates total compute unit usage per transaction
- Handles loading states and error management
- Includes refresh functionality for manual updates
- Smart parsing of transaction logs to extract compute unit data

### 4. **UI Component** (`src/components/compute/TransactionList.tsx`)

- Displays transaction list with rich information:
  - Transaction signature with Solana Explorer link
  - Timestamp (relative time format)
  - Transaction status (success/failed/pending) with color coding
  - Number of compute units used (formatted for readability)
  - Approximate fee paid in SOL/lamports
  - Slot number and block information
- Expandable instruction details showing per-instruction compute usage
- Loading states with skeleton animations
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Responsive design optimized for dark theme

### 5. **Integration** (`src/app/page.tsx`)

- Added TransactionList component to home page below header
- Proper client-side rendering setup
- Hook integration for real-time transaction data
- Maintains existing UI layout and functionality

## ðŸ”§ Technical Features

### **Compute Unit Analysis**

- Parses transaction logs to extract actual compute unit consumption
- Falls back to instruction-based estimation when logs unavailable
- Provides per-instruction breakdown with instruction type identification
- Aggregates total compute units per transaction

### **Transaction Parsing**

- Supports both parsed and partially decoded instructions
- Extracts comprehensive transaction metadata
- Handles various transaction states and error conditions
- Provides detailed fee information

### **Performance Optimizations**

- Efficient RPC calls with minimal data fetching
- Proper React state management with useCallback optimization
- Loading states prevent UI blocking
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### **User Experience**

- Relative timestamps (e.g., "2m ago", "1h ago")
- Formatted compute units (e.g., "5.2K CU", "1.2M CU")
- Color-coded transaction status indicators
- External links to Solana Explorer for detailed transaction view
- Expandable details for power users
- Refresh button for manual updates

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Instructions

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the improved wallet connection (now using WalletMultiButton)
2. **View Transactions**: Recent transactions appear automatically below the main tools grid
3. **Verify Data**: Each transaction shows:
   - âœ… Signature and Solana Explorer link
   - âœ… Timestamp and slot information
   - âœ… Status (success/failed with color coding)
   - âœ… Compute unit usage (total and per-instruction)
   - âœ… Fee information in SOL
4. **Test Interactions**:
   - Click "View instruction details" to see per-instruction breakdown
   - Click the "â†—" link to view transaction on Solana Explorer
   - Use "Refresh" button to update transaction list
   - Test with different wallet states (connected/disconnected)

## ðŸ›  Implementation Details

### **Smart Compute Unit Parsing**

The implementation uses advanced log parsing to extract real compute unit consumption:

```typescript
// Pattern matching for compute unit logs
const computeMatch = log.match(/consumed (\d+) of \d+ compute units/);
```

### **Fallback Estimation**

When exact data isn't available, provides reasonable estimates:

```typescript
// Fallback estimation based on instruction count
totalComputeUnits = transaction.transaction.message.instructions.length * 5000;
```

### **Error-Resistant Design**

All functions include proper error handling and graceful degradation:

- Network failures show user-friendly error messages
- Missing data doesn't break the UI
- Loading states provide clear feedback

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The implementation is:

- âœ… Type-safe with comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- âœ… Performance optimized with proper React patterns
- âœ… Error-resistant with graceful failure handling
- âœ… User-friendly with intuitive UI/UX
- âœ… Extensible for future enhancements
- âœ… Well-documented with clear code structure

**Commit**: `Show recent transactions and compute unit usage for connected wallet`

The feature is now live and ready for testing with any connected Solana wallet on devnet!
